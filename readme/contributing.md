To rebuild & run the tests

    $ mkdir tanglejs
    $ cd tanglejs
    $ git clone https://github.com/tanglejs/new-plugin.git
    $ cd new
    $ npm install
    $ grunt test

You can use `grunt watch` to automatically rebuild and run the test suite when
files are changed.

Use `npm link` from the project directory to tell `tangle` to use
your modified `tangle-new-plugin` during development.

To contribute back, fork the repo and open a pull request with your changes.
