[tangle](https://github.com/tanglejs/tangle) is a set of tools
for building web applications.

`tangle-new-plugin` implements the `new-plugin` subcommand for
[tangle](https://github.com/tanglejs/tangle).

It also happens to be a generator for [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io), though
it does not follow the `generator-` naming convention.

`tangle-new-plugin` runs interactively. It will ask you to answer some
questions about the plugin you are creating, and then generate the necessary
files in the current directory.
